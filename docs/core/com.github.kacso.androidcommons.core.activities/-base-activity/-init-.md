`BaseActivity()`

Abstract [AppCompatActivity](#) class which implements common functionalities from [BaseView](../../com.github.kacso.androidcommons.core.views/-base-view/index.md) and solves
most common tasks in Activity.

It is advisable that all activities in project extend this class.

In case that you are implementing this class, make sure to implement [IBaseViewModel](../../com.github.kacso.androidcommons.core.mvvm.viewmodels/-i-base-view-model/index.md) within your activity.
